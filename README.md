##Brief Background on the Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

##Descrition of the raw data
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

fBodyAcc-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

##Project requirements
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Steps in Analysis

1. Set the working directory to the parent directory of the UCI HAR dataset
2. Read the data into R
    + Read the training data set - train,y,subjects
    + Read the test data set - test,y, subjects
    + Merge the training data together to create a training data table
      that includes the information about activity and subject for each observation row
    + Merge the test data together to create a test data table
      that includes the information about activity and subject for each observation row
    + Merge the tables from the previous two steps to have a single table that has all
      the training and test data
    + The merged data set contains 10299 observations of 68 variables
    + Read the features files and use it to generate column names for the merged table
    + The first step in making the data tidy is selecting only the columns with calculations       for mean and standard deviations. From the features information that is available in         the data set, this meant selecting only columns with mean() and std() in their names.
    + Get labels for activities for replacing the activity code with corresponding label.         Use the activities text file that was in the data set.
    + Convert the activity column to a factor variable
    + Replace column names with more meaning names using pattern matching. Descriptive            labels will indicate whether its a time/frequency signal for Acceleromater/Gyroscope.       Also replace open and close parentheses and -.
    + The last steps is to calculate the mean of each measurement for each subject for each        activity. Accomplished using the summarise_each function.
    + This gives us our final data. Also sorted this on subject by activity for better            readabilty. This is a data set of 180 observations of 68 variables.
    + The last step is to write it to a text file for submission.
